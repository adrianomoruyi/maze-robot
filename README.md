# This is the final project from COE538: Microprocessor Systems at Toronto Metropolitan University.

The purpose of this proect is to demonstrate the ability to program the eebot to navigate through a maze (defined by black electrical tape).
The eebot uses the HSC12 microcontroller to manage the logic of this project. The associated report can be found in this repository.

## Technologies used

- HSC12 Assembly
- CodeWarrior IDE
- eebot Maze Robot (HSC12 microcontroller)
